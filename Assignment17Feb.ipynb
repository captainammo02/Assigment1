    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents, which can have dynamic schemas, making it easier to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, as the name suggests, do not use the traditional relational data model used in SQL databases. Instead, they offer a more flexible and scalable data model that can handle large volumes of data, complex data types, and different data structures. Non-relational databases are often preferred in scenarios where data is unstructured, semi-structured, or has varying attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexibility is crucial: As mentioned earlier, MongoDB has a flexible schema model that allows you to store data without defining a fixed schema in advance. This flexibility is essential when working with unstructured data, as you can easily add or remove fields as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.High scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable, and it can handle large volumes of data with ease. It has built-in sharding capabilities, which enable you to distribute data across multiple servers, thus improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Faster development: MongoDB is quicker to set up and start using compared to SQL databases. Its document-oriented data model makes it easy to map data to objects in programming languages like Python, Java, or Ruby, which speeds up development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.High availability: MongoDB provides high availability and fault tolerance, with automatic failover and replica sets. This means that even if one server fails, there will be another available to handle requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Complex queries: MongoDB offers a flexible query language that allows for more complex queries than SQL databases. Its query language supports dynamic queries, full-text search, and geospatial queries."

    "1.Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which stores data in JSON-like documents. This makes it easier to work with semi-structured and unstructured data, as you don't need to define a fixed schema in advance.\n",

    "2.Flexible schema: MongoDB's flexible schema allows you to store data without defining a fixed schema in advance. This means you can add or remove fields as needed, which is useful when working with data that may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.High scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means you can add more servers to handle increased traffic and data storage requirements. It also supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing for faster query performance. It also supports geospatial indexes for location-based queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Aggregation framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework provides a flexible and powerful way to analyze and manipulate data. It allows you to perform complex data analysis operations like grouping, filtering, and sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Full-text search: MongoDB supports full-text search, which allows you to search for text across all fields in a collection.\n",
