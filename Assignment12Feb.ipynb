    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are raised when the interpreter encounters an error that it cannot handle.\n",

    "The main differences between exceptions and syntax errors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Timing: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter when it first reads your code, before the program even starts running. Exceptions, on the other hand, are raised during the execution of a program, when an error occurs that cannot be handled by the current code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Cause: Syntax errors are caused by incorrect syntax, such as missing brackets or semicolons. Exceptions are caused by errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as attempting to divide by zero or accessing an index that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Handling: Syntax errors can be fixed by correcting the code that caused them. Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, which allow you to catch the exception and handle it gracefully without causing the program to crash."
