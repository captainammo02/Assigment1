    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class, created using the class blueprint. It represents a specific entity that has its own unique properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of a class called \"Person.\" This class can have properties such as \"name,\" \"age,\" and \"gender,\" and behaviors such as \"speak,\" \"walk,\" and \"eat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object of the Person class, we can instantiate it by assigning values to its properties. For instance, we can create an object of the Person class with the name \"John,\" age \"25,\" and gender \"male.\" This object would represent a specific person with the given properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the behaviors of the Person class to manipulate the object's properties. For example, we can call the \"speak\" method on the Person object to make them say something, or the \"walk\" method to make them move.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Person class example illustrates how a class can be used to define the properties and behaviors of a person, and how objects of that class can be created to represent specific instances of a person with their own unique properties and behaviors."

    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world and instead exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object. This allows objects to be treated as black boxes, with their internal workings hidden from the user. Encapsulation helps to promote modular code, as objects can be modified without affecting the rest of the codebase. It also helps to enforce data integrity, as data can only be modified through the object's public interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, abstraction is achieved by defining abstract classes or interfaces that specify the basic behaviors that a group of related objects should have. Concrete classes can then inherit from these abstract classes or interfaces and provide their own implementation of the required behaviors. Abstraction helps to promote code reusability and maintainability, as common behaviors can be defined in abstract classes and reused throughout the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is the practice of creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting the properties and behaviors of the parent class. Inheritance helps to promote code reuse and modularity, as it allows for the creation of specialized classes that can be built on top of more general classes. It also helps to promote code maintenance, as changes to the parent class will be reflected in all of its child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they share a common interface. Polymorphism allows for code to be written that can work with a variety of objects, without needing to know the specific details of each object. This helps to promote code flexibility and reusability, as objects can be swapped in and out without affecting the functionality of the code."
